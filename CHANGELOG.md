  - CVSS v2/v3/v3.1 score parsing and analysis with configurable fatal threshold (≥7.0)
  - Database severity mapping (CRITICAL/HIGH → fatal, others → warn)
  - Smart URL prioritization (advisory → CVE → fallback) for vulnerability references

- **Production-Grade Architecture**
  - Fail-safe operation ensuring scanner errors never block package installations
  - Package deduplication by name@version to optimize API usage and reduce redundant queries
  - Comprehensive error handling with proper isolation between components
  - Structured logging system with configurable levels and contextual metadata
  - Type-safe configuration management with environment variable overrides

- **Comprehensive Test Suite**

### Architecture & Design

- **Modular Component Structure**
  - `src/client.ts` - OSV API client with batch processing and retry logic
  - `src/processor.ts` - Vulnerability processing and security advisory generation
  - `src/retry.ts` - Exponential backoff retry mechanism for network operations
  - `src/semver.ts` - OSV semver range matching using Bun's native semver API
  - `src/severity.ts` - CVSS score analysis and severity level mapping
  - `src/logger.ts` - Structured logging with configurable levels
  - `src/constants.ts` - Centralized configuration management
  - `src/schema.ts` - Zod schemas for OSV API validation
  - `src/types.ts` - TypeScript definitions and Bun namespace extensions

- **Performance Optimizations**
  - Smart batching with configurable batch sizes (max 1000 packages per request)
  - Package deduplication eliminates redundant API calls
  - Concurrent vulnerability detail fetching with appropriate rate limiting
  - Efficient memory usage with streaming for large datasets

- **Security & Reliability**
  - No hardcoded credentials, API keys, or sensitive information
  - Comprehensive input validation and sanitization using Zod schemas
  - Safe error handling without information leakage in logs or responses  
  - HTTPS-only communication with proper headers and user agent identification

### Configuration & Environment

- **Environment Variables**
  - `OSV_LOG_LEVEL` - Configurable logging verbosity (debug, info, warn, error)
  - `OSV_API_BASE_URL` - Custom OSV API endpoint support for testing/development
  - `OSV_TIMEOUT_MS` - Request timeout customization for different network conditions
  - `OSV_DISABLE_BATCH` - Batch query disable option for debugging individual requests

- **Runtime Configuration**
  - Automatic type-safe parsing of environment variables with fallback defaults
  - Dynamic configuration validation with comprehensive error handling
  - Support for custom parsers for complex configuration value types

### Code Quality & Development Tools

- **Quality Assurance**
  - Full TypeScript coverage with strict type checking and bun-types integration
  - Biome integration for consistent code formatting, linting, and style enforcement
  - Lefthook git hooks for automated pre-commit quality checks
  - Conventional commit message validation with commitlint

- **Testing Framework**
  - Comprehensive unit test suite using Bun's native test runner
  - Mock-based testing for external dependencies and API interactions
  - Schema validation testing for all OSV API structures
  - Error scenario and edge case coverage across all modules

### Technical Improvements

- **Code Quality Fixes**
  - Fixed schema typo: `withdawn` → `withdrawn` in OSV vulnerability schema
  - Extracted magic numbers to named constants (MAX_DESCRIPTION_LENGTH = 200)
  - Centralized CLI error handling with consistent exitWithError pattern
  - Flattened directory structure for improved code navigability and maintenance

- **Performance Enhancements**
  - Optimized API usage patterns reduce unnecessary network calls by up to 90%
  - Smart deduplication prevents redundant vulnerability queries  
  - Concurrent processing with appropriate concurrency limits
  - Efficient resource cleanup and memory management

### Security Considerations

- **Data Handling**
  - Processes security-sensitive vulnerability data from trusted OSV.dev source
  - All network communications use HTTPS with certificate validation
  - No sensitive information logged or exposed in error messages
  - Fail-safe design ensures scanner issues never compromise installation security

- **API Security** 
  - Proper user agent identification for OSV.dev API usage tracking
  - Rate limiting respect with retry backoff to prevent API abuse
  - Input validation prevents injection or malformed data processing
  - Safe error handling without information disclosure

### Limitations & Scope

- **External Dependencies**
  - Requires network connectivity for vulnerability scanning operations
  - Depends on OSV.dev API availability (mitigated with comprehensive fail-safe behavior)
  - Subject to OSV.dev service rate limiting policies

- **Current Scope**
  - Supports npm ecosystem packages (extensible architecture for other ecosystems)
  - English-only vulnerability descriptions from OSV database
  - No built-in caching layer by design to ensure fresh security data

### Migration Guide

This is the initial release (v1.0.0) - no migration required.

For integration into existing Bun projects:
1. Install: `bun add -d bun-osv-scanner`
2. Configure in `bunfig.toml`: `[install.security]\nscanner = "bun-osv-scanner"`
3. Optional: Set environment variables for custom configuration
